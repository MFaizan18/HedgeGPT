# HedgeGPT
Unlock next-generation option pricing and hedging with an AI-powered reinforcement-learning framework built on the Black–Scholes model

## 1) What Exactly Is HedgeGPT?
HedgeGPT is a sophisticated trading and risk-management engine that leverages Q-learning to price and dynamically hedge European options. Rather than relying purely on closed-form formulas, HedgeGPT uses large-scale Monte Carlo simulation of underlying asset paths, encodes the market state with B-spline basis functions, and trains a Q-learner to discover optimal hedging strategies in a simulated Black–Scholes world. The result is an AI agent that learns to replicate option payoffs and manage risk in a fully automated, data-driven fashion.

## 2) Key Features

**2.1) Monte Carlo Backbone**

* Simulates tens of thousands of asset‐price paths under risk‐neutral dynamics to capture path dependency and nonlinear payoffs in a single, unified framework.

**2.2) B-Spline State Encoding**

* Transforms log-prices into a compact, continuous feature space, enabling smooth, high-resolution representation of market states.

**2.3) Q-Learning Hedging Agent**

* Learns optimal hedge ratios by maximizing a variance-based reward, striking the right balance between hedging P&L and portfolio variance.

**2.4) Variance-Based Reward Function**

* Penalizes portfolio volatility while rewarding accurate payoff replication, adapting dynamically to changing market conditions.

**2.5) Transparent Black–Scholes Benchmark**

* Directly compares the agent’s learned option price to the analytic Black–Scholes price, providing an intuitive gauge of model performance.

## 3) Why Use HedgeGPT?
Whether you’re a quant researcher, risk manager, or developer building automated strategies, HedgeGPT provides:

* Deep AI Integration: Combines reinforcement learning with classical finance theory.

* Risk-Aware Pricing: Explicit variance control yields robust option valuations.

* Extensibility: Swap in different reward functions, market simulators, or basis encodings.

* Educational Value: See firsthand how an AI agent discovers the famed delta‐hedging strategy.

## 5) Core Formulas and Computations

Below is a detailed rundown of every mathematical formula used in main.py, organized by the five main computation stages

**5.1) Asset‐Price Simulation (Geometric Brownian Motion)**

![Asset‐Price Simulation (Geometric Brownian Motion)](Geometric_Brownian_Motion.png)

What it is: A discrete‐time approximation to the continuous Black–Scholes dynamics.

Why we use it: We need a large ensemble of possible future paths `S` under the real-world drift `𝜇` to train our hedging agent. Even though pricing is risk‐neutral, we simulate with `𝜇` so that our state variables `𝑋` capture realistic drift.

How it fits: These simulated paths feed into both the replicating‐portfolio regression and the Q‐learning agent’s experience.

## 5.2) Discount Factor

![Discount Factor](Discount_Factor.png)

What it is: The per‐step factor to discount monetary payoffs back one time increment.

Why we use it: In both the replicating‐portfolio rollback and the Q‐learning Bellman equation, future values must be discounted at the risk‐free rate 
`r`.

How it fits: Each backward step multiplies by `γ` to translate future cash flows into present value.

## 5.3) Risk‐Neutral Returns & Demeaning

![Risk‐Neutral Returns & Demeaning](Risk‐Neutral_Returns_&_Demeaning.png)

What it is: The excess return beyond the growth at the risk‐free rate, then centered around zero.

Why we use it: In our regression for the hedge ratio, we need returns with zero mean so that the linear system 
`𝐴𝜙 = 𝐵` remains well‐conditioned.

How it fits: `^ΔS` enters the `A‐matrix` (variance weights) and the `B‐vector` (covariance with future portfolio payoffs).

## 5.4) State Variable

![State Variable](State_Variable.png)

What it is: A drift‐corrected log‐price used as the input to spline basis functions.

Why we use it: By subtracting `(μ− 1/2σ)tΔt`, we remove the deterministic drift component and isolate the stochastic part of `lnS`.

How it fits: `X k,t` is what we “encode” via B‐splines to build our approximate value/hedge functions.

## 5.5) B‐Spline Basis Evaluation

1. Choose collocation points `{τi}` across the range of `X`.

2. Build a knot vector `k` of order `p=4`.

3. For each flattened x, evaluate `Bj​(x)=splev(x,(k,ej,p−1))`.

Reshape into a tensor of shape `(T+1, N MC, nbasis)`.

Why we use it: B‐splines provide a smooth, overcomplete set of basis functions that can flexibly approximate any value or hedge‐ratio function of the state.

How it fits: These basis evaluations become the design matrix `Φt` in both the replicating‐portfolio regression and the Q‐function regression.
